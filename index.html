      <p>hello world<br>
         i got an idea at a lecture today.<br>
         chatgpt has this voice thing that could be used for <br>making anki decks
         anki is a program that makes flashcards and has an a<br>lgorithm for <u>spaced repetition</u>
         chatgpt allows you to make custom gpts ie you chat w<br>ith the thing but it has rules you've set for it
         chatgpt also easily makes txt files<br>
         anki flashcards are stored as txt files with very si<br>mple syntax ie "question" <i>three spaces</i> "answer" <i>some other formatting stuff</i>
         <br>
         so you make a custom gpt that always makes a txt fil<br>e of random stuff you tell it at the end of the day and then you just put that into anki
         or you put it into your own app an make money. but t<br>hats a later step
         but i like that idea. it lets you learn how to conne<br>ct a microphone to an app, how to design an app (or get to know someone who does) and write a simple spaced repition algorithm
<br>
         someone has probably already made something like thi<br>s but it probably sucks for everyone except the person who made it
         and mine will probably also suck for everyone except<br> myself
         but its nevertheless an interesting project<br>
         it requires me to learn how to get chatgpt into an e<br>xternal app (thats another thing that would be cool, like cursor has ctrl+l and boom you have every AI right there)
         and as i said it requires me to learn how to connect<br> a mic to an app
<br>
         imagine this:<br>
         you get home from school and nooo you have to study<br>
         getting out the book and something to write on is an<br>noying
         you talk to chatgpt and vent for 10 mine<br>
         chatgpt is nice to you and it prepares some flashcar<br>ds for tomorrow and a to-do list
         <br>
         im starting this reporting back tomorrow or whenever<br>

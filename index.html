      <p>hello world<br>
         i got an idea at a lecture today.<br>
         chatgpt has this voice thing that could be used for making anki decks<br>
         anki is a program that makes flashcards and has an algorithm for <u>spaced repetition</u><br>
         chatgpt allows you to make custom gpts ie you chat with the thing but it has rules you've set for it<br>
         chatgpt also easily makes txt files<br>
         anki flashcards are stored as txt files with very simple syntax ie "question" <i>three spaces</i> "answer" <i>some other formatting stuff</i><br>
         so you make a custom gpt that always makes a txt file of random stuff you tell it at the end of the day and then you just put that into anki<br>
         or you put it into your own app an make money. but thats a later step<br>
         but i like that idea. it lets you learn how to connect a microphone to an app, how to design an app (or get to know someone who does) and write a simple spaced repition algorithm<br>
         <br>
         someone has probably already made something like this but it probably sucks for everyone except the person who made it<br>
         and mine will probably also suck for everyone except myself<br>
         but its nevertheless an interesting project<br>
         it requires me to learn how to get chatgpt into an external app (thats another thing that would be cool, like cursor has ctrl+l and boom you have every AI right there)<br>
         and as i said it requires me to learn how to connect a mic to an app<br>
         <br>
         imagine this:<br>
         you get home from school and nooo you have to study<br>
         getting out the book and something to write on is annoying<br>
         you talk to chatgpt and vent for 10 mine<br>
         chatgpt is nice to you and it prepares some flashcards for tomorrow and a to-do list<br>
         im starting this reporting back tomorrow or whenever<br>

      <p>hello world
         i got an idea at a lecture today.
         chatgpt has this voice thing that could be used for making anki decks
         anki is a program that makes flashcards and has an algorithm for <u>spaced repetition</u>
         chatgpt allows you to make custom gpts ie you chat with the thing but it has rules you've set for it
         chatgpt also easily makes txt files
         anki flashcards are stored as txt files with very simple syntax ie "question" <i>three spaces</i> "answer" <i>some other formatting stuff</i>
         
         so you make a custom gpt that always makes a txt file of random stuff you tell it at the end of the day and then you just put that into anki
         or you put it into your own app an make money. but thats a later step
         but i like that idea. it lets you learn how to connect a microphone to an app, how to design an app (or get to know someone who does) and write a simple spaced repition algorithm

         someone has probably already made something like this but it probably sucks for everyone except the person who made it
         and mine will probably also suck for everyone except myself
         but its nevertheless an interesting project
         it requires me to learn how to get chatgpt into an external app (thats another thing that would be cool, like cursor has ctrl+l and boom you have every AI right there)
         and as i said it requires me to learn how to connect a mic to an app

         imagine this:
         you get home from school and nooo you have to study
         getting out the book and something to write on is annoying
         you talk to chatgpt and vent for 10 mine
         chatgpt is nice to you and it prepares some flashcards for tomorrow and a to-do list
         
         im starting this reporting back tomorrow or whenever
